# Coach V5 Roadmap

> Living status for narrative architecture work.  
> Source of truth for arc design: `COACH_V5_NARRATIVE_ARCHITECTURE.md`

---

## North star

**Arc появляется только тогда, когда течение времени меняет решение тренера.**

Chapters live in the **narrative layer** — not as new `CoachFinalStoryOwner` values.

## Shipped

### Endurance Narrative vertical ✅

| Phase | Scope | Commit | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| **A** | Coach Hero follows engine narrative owner for activity-bound stories | `f909a15` | ✅ Shipped |
| **B** | Endurance Arc — Opening → Establish → Maintain → Protect → Recovery Window | `fb16d58` | ✅ Shipped |

**Activities:** Cycling, Running · duration ≥ 60 min  
**Docs:** `COACH_ENDURANCE_NARRATIVE_ARC.md` · `COACH_PHASE_B_CHAPTER_SCREEN_AUDIT.md`

**Architecture pattern (reuse for future arcs):**

```
Activity Family → Arc Template → Chapter (narrative layer)
    → Copy catalog (Coach Hero / Read / Rec)
    → CoachEnduranceTodayTeaserCopy (Today tactical lines)
    → Owners unchanged (priority + deficit override)
```

## Planned

## Explicitly not in scope (this cycle)

- ML / feel-based chapter detection
- Large architectural refactors outside arc families
